what is mqtt?
Ans :-  MQTT is a publish-subscribe communication protocol that organizes data into topics, orchestrated by a broker. Think of the broker as a compartmentalized bulletin board.MQTT also boasts of several other features that find a lot of applications in IoT. It supports ‘retained’ messages, wherein the broker can retain a copy of a message on a topic and send it to any future subscriber to that topic.
